Infrastructure

-   Developer sees an automatic build and deploy of the local server when changes are made to source code and saved
-   Developer has a clear separation between code and built binaries
-   Developer can use easy to use commands (from package.json) to build and deploy test server
-   Developer should code in TypeScript instead of JavaScript
-   Developer can write and run unit tests against the code
